# Features TODO

## Constructor

Currently, Ola smart contracts do not support constructors. Initialization can only be done manually within the contract by writing methods like init. Constructors and state variable initialization will be supported in the future.

## Transaction revert

Currently, when an error occurs during transaction execution in Ola smart contracts, specific revert information is not provided. This will be supported in the future.

## Inheritance and polymorphism

Currently, Ola smart contracts support interfaces and libraries but lack contract inheritance. This will be supported in the future.

## Contract constants

Currently, Ola does not support constants because it requires a dedicated constant storage area to be set up on the backend. This will be supported in the future.
